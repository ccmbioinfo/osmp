# A one-sided variant matching portal to support rare disease research

The One-Sided Matching Portal (OSMP) enables researchers to query patient variant and phenotype data from many different sources simultaneously. Acting as a hub connecting disparate data sources, the portal processes user queries, routes them to their respective endpoints with appropriate authorization, and amalgamates their results into a single, easily-searchable collection displayed in a user-friendly interface. By allowing researchers to search patient data from several research institutions with a single query, the OSMP can significantly speed up the process of rare disease “matching” across institutions and datasets.

The instructions of setting up local development environment and the description of the staging and the production instance can be found in the folder `docs`.
